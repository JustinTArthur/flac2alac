flac2alac is a shell script to convert FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) files to ALAC (Apple Lossless Audio Codec) format, used on iPod/iPhone/iPad.

You can use it to convert a single .flac file to .m4a, like

 flac2alac file.flac

flac2alac takes only one flac file as parameter (i.e. converts only one file per time). You can, however, convert all files in a given directory using a bash loop:

 for i in *flac ; do flac2alac "$i" ; done

A easy way to install on Linux is making it executable and copying it to a directory in your path, like

 chmod +x flac2alac && sudo cp flac2alac /usr/local/bin

flac2m4a uses flac and ffmpeg to decode/encode the audio files. On Ubuntu, you can install them with

 sudo apt-get install flac ffmpeg

Enjoy.
